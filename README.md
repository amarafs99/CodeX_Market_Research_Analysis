# Data Analysis Project: Understanding Consumer Preferences and Market Strategies for CodeX Energy Drink

This data analysis project explores consumer preferences and market strategies for CodeX Energy Drink, a prominent player in the energy drink industry. Using Python's powerful data manipulation libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and visualization tools like Matplotlib, the project uncovers crucial insights that can shape the brand's growth and success.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following key steps:

1. Data Import: Importing the necessary libraries and loading the data from three CSV files containing survey responses, respondent details, and city information.

2. Data Merging: Combining the data from the three CSV files using the `pd.merge()` function to create a consolidated DataFrame named 'df'.

3. Data Exploration: Exploring the 'df' DataFrame to understand the structure of the data.

4. Demographic Insights: Analyzing energy drink preferences across genders and age groups using bar charts.

5. Marketing Strategies: Evaluating the effectiveness of marketing channels, especially for the youth (15-30 age group), through bar charts.

6. Consumer Preferences: Understanding the preferred ingredients and packaging choices of respondents using bar charts.

7. Competition Analysis: Identifying current market leaders and reasons for their popularity over CodeX through bar charts.

8. Brand Awareness: Assessing how consumers perceive CodeX and identifying cities where brand awareness needs improvement using pie charts.

9. Purchase Behavior: Analyzing preferred purchase locations and typical consumption situations for energy drinks using pie charts.

10. Product Development: Identifying areas for product improvement (branding, taste, and availability) based on bar charts.

11. Data Export: Saving the final enriched dataset with insights and recommendations as 'Final_Data_CodeX.csv'.
